# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This truly is my passion project. I used NASA open API to gather information and display it in one place. Right now, i only have the mobile version set up because React Router DOM complicates things in terms of reorginizing the different screens in the app. I intially wanted it to just be a mobile up but I dont think I can do that if its not made with React Native. Regardless, id like to offer not only the mobile version - to show I can work through responsive design - but also a desk top version that is just one big dashboard. 
The different APIs each have a route dedicated to them. I mapped through the data from the API and fed it into a js slider I found online so the user can swipe through all the information. For the asteroids I made it so the user can pick a date projected out a week I belive. Im really proud of this app so far.
